# Smart-Band-for-Woman-Safety
The WomenSafety Band is designed for the safety of women during difficult times. The prototype consists of Arduino UNO, GSM Module, GPS Module and MPU6050 accelerometer sensor.The sensor, GSM and GPS module are connected to the microcontroller ArduinoUNO and the programming is done in Arduino IDE. When the woman makes a particular hand gesture that is predefined, the Microcontroller sends a signal and GPS is activated and coordinates of the person is sent through GSM Module to the persons registered. This is the working of Women Safety Band.
